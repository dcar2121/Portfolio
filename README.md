Portfolio overview — Secure Digital Rights & Royalty Engineering

This folder contains two focused samples to demonstrate domain expertise:

1) auditable-royalty-ledger/ — small demo of an auditable ledger for royalty events (metadata ingestion → ledger entry → reconciliation report)
2) encrypted-watermarking-poc/ — proof-of-concept for embedding encrypted watermarks and an automated takedown workflow

Each sample includes a README with goals, architecture, quick-start, and sample outputs. Use these as interview demos or links on LinkedIn/GitHub.
